This document contains a description of the data and how to download and 
install it.

The setup for our experiments requires that all the archives are extracted 
in the same directory (we call this the experiment directory). The archives 
contain local paths and these are important for a correct setup.

metadata.xml and metadata_renders.xml must be copied in that directory as well. These
file accompany this distribution and the copy is done automatically with the setup. The files
contains information about the database file names, number of frames, camera parameters, etc.
